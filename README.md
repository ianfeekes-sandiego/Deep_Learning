# Deep Learning
This repository contains all the programming work done by Ian Feekes (ianfeekes@gmail.com) for the University of San Diego MS. Applied Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning program's Deep Learning class.

## Assignment 2 - MLP Regressor for Boston Housing
In this notebook, I examine the boston housing assignment and perform deep learning using an MLP Regressor ANN

## Assignment 3 - CNN for MNIST
Here, I build a CNN multiclassifier for the MNIST hand-written digits dataset.

## Assignment 4 - LSTM for Apple Stock Prediction
This assignment's notebook creates a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with Long-Term-Short-Term (LSTM) nodes that leverage time-series stock data for prediction

## Assignment 5 - LSTM for IMBD Reviews
This notebook leverages a RNN with LSTM nodes trained on movie reviews to perform sentiment analysis.

## Assignment 6 - Autoencoder for MNIST
The notebook written for this assignment constructs and autoencoder neural network that is able to correctly classify generated images of the MNIST handwritten dataset.

## Assignment 7 - Recommender for Movielens Movie Ratings
This assignment builds a recommender model with embedded layers for matrix factorization between users and movies.
